# language-project

This project aims to analyze speaker-specific information prominence within an utterance, with a hypothesis suggesting that this prominence is highest at the beginning of an utterance compared to its middle or end.

The datasets utilized for this study were retrieved from Common Voice, and the hypothesis was tested across three languages: Mandarin, Cantonese, and English.
